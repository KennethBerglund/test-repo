        <h2>How to Make Chicken Piccata
            Part :1 The Pan-Fry
        </h2>
        <li>Slice the chicken breasts horizontally—you’ll need a 
            sharp knife for this, obviously! The reason you cut 
            the chicken breast into thin pieces is so that they 
            can cook evenly during the pan-frying process. 
            Thin pieces of chicken mean that when the outside is 
            crispy and perfectly brown, 
            the chicken will be cooked through. Magic!</li>
            <li>
                Dredge! Season the chicken breast pieces, 
                and then give them a nice coating of flour. 
                For whatever reason, kids really love to help
                 out with this step. If they’re old enough to
                  know to be careful with raw poultry,
                 go ahead and outsource this step to them! 
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry! Fry the chicken cutlets in a 
                combination of olive oil and butter. 
                The oil—use regular light olive oil, 
                not extra virgin—helps prevent the butter
                 from burning, plus,
                 we love the flavor of both!

                <h2>How to Make Chicken Piccata Part 2: The Piccata Sauce
                </h2>
                <h3>Our    piccata sauce is simply a pan sauce, 
                    which means that we use the good crispy, 
                    chicken-tinged buttery bits that are left in 
                    the skillet after frying the chicken cutlets to make a sauce. 
                    Here’s how to make this lemony piccata sauce:
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sauté shallots and garlic in the pan drippings—i.e. 
                        the leftover oil and butter.</li>
                        <li>Add stock! Simmer for a few minutes to reduce it.
                        </li>
                        <li>Stir in more butter, plus the requisite capers and lemon juice.
                        </li>
                        <li>Season with a little salt and pepper.
                        </li>
                        <li>That's it! You made a pan sauce!
                        </li>
                </ol>
